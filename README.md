‚è∞ [Timers](https://ayumukasuga.github.io/timers/)
===============================================

Just playing with React...

Features:
* add timer
* modify timer
* remove timer

* turn on web notifications (currently it works only if tab with application is open)
* All timers saved in localStorage.

It works only in __modern__ browsers.
